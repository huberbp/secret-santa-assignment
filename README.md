# secret-santa-assignment
A fun app made to help people with secret-santa assignment.
## How to Use
1. Have 2 "captains" who are in charge of distributing the secret santa info (who is assigned to who).
2. Have a file in the same directory as the python app that contains a list of all the particpants, including yourselves, in a single column (delimited by newlines).
3. One of you will run the app on your computer, providing info as requested.
   - Ensure that when the app prompts for the captains' names you provide same name that is written in the list file.
4. The app will generate two files, named after each captain.  Give the other captain their file without looking at it.
5. Enjoy!  Everyone gives gifts to the person beneath them on this list.  (If you are at the bottom of the list, you give to the captain, woohoo!)
